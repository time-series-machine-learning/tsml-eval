This directory contains instructions and utilities for running experiments using
tsml-eval on University of East Anglia (UEA), University of Southampton (Soton) and
University of Bradford hardware.

For non-UEA/Soton/Bradford users, the directory contents are likely irrelevant.
Some of the contents could be adapted for other purposes or could be generalised
for other Slurm/Linux devices, but running the scripts or following the hardware
instructions will likely achieve nothing without alterations.
