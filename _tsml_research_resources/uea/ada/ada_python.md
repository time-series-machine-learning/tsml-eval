# ADA Python

Installation guide for Python packages on ADA and useful slurm commands.

The [HPC webpage](https://my.uea.ac.uk/divisions/it-and-computing-services/service-catalogue/research-it-services/hpc/ada-cluster) provides a lot of useful information and getting started guides for using ADA.

Server address: ada.uea.ac.uk

## Windows interaction with ADA

You need to be on a UEA network machine or have the VPN running to connect to ADA. Connect to ada.uea.ac.uk.

The recommended way of connecting to ADA is using Putty as a command-line interface and WinSCP for file management.

Copies of data files used in experiments must be stored on the cluster, the best place to put these files is on your user area scratch storage. Alternatively, you can read from someone else's directory (i.e. ajb).

## Installing on the cluster

Complete these steps sequentially for a fresh installation.

### 1. Enter interactive mode

By default, commands will be run on the login node. Beyond simple commands or scripts, an interactive session should be started.

>interactive

### 2. Clone the code from GitHub

The default location for files should be your user area. Either copy over the code files you want to run manually or clone them from a GitHub page.

>git clone GITHUB_LINK

e.g. https://github.com/time-series-machine-learning/tsml-eval

### 3. Activate an ADA Python installation

Python is activated by default, but it is good practice to manually select the version used. The ADA module should be added before creating and editing an environment.

>module add python/anaconda/2019.10/3.7

You may also need to activate the shell script like this to use some conda commands:

>source /gpfs/software/ada/python/anaconda/2019.10/3.7/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

You can check the current version using:

>conda --version

>python --version

### 4. Create a conda environment

Create a new environment with a name of your choice. Replace PYTHON_VERSION with 3.10 for CPU jobs and 3.8 for GPU jobs.

>conda create -n ENV_NAME python=PYTHON_VERSION

Activate the new environment.

>conda activate ENV_NAME

Your environment should be listed now when you use the following command:

>conda info --envs

__Tip__: instead of running the module, source, and conda activate commands every time, if the following line is added to the .bashrc file everything is done in one step (command ALIAS_NAME):

>alias ALIAS_NAME="module add python/anaconda/2019.10/3.7; source /gpfs/software/ada/python/anaconda/2019.10/3.7/etc/profile.d/conda.sh; conda activate ENV_NAME;"

Note that this ALIAS_NAME has to be run after the interactive.

### 5. Install package and dependencies

Install the package and required dependencies. The following are examples for a few packages and scenarios.

After installation, the installed packages can be viewed with:

>pip list

>conda list

Note that you can install a specific GitHub branch for packages such as `aeon` like so

>pip uninstall aeon

>pip install git+https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon.git@main

or

> pip install git+https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon.git@ajb/stc

#### 5.1. tsml-eval CPU

Move to the package directory and run:

>pip install --editable .

For release specific dependency versions you can also run:

>pip install -r requirements.txt

Extras may be required, install as needed i.e.:

>pip install esig tsfresh

For some extras you may need a gcc installation i.e.:

>module add gcc/11.1.0

Most extra dependencies can be installed with the all_extras dependency set:

>pip install -e .[all_extras]

Some dependencies are unstable, so the following may fail to install.

>pip install -e .[all_extras,unstable_extras]

If any a dependency install is "Killed", it is likely the interactive session has run out of memory. Either give it more memory, or use a non-cached package i.e.

>pip install PACKAGE_NAME --no-cache-dir

#### 5.2. tsml-eval GPU

For GPU jobs we require two additional ADA modules, CUDA and cuDNN:

>module add cuda/10.2.89

>module add cudnn/7.6.5

A specific Tensorflow version is required to match the available CUDA install.

>pip install --editable . tensorflow==2.3.0

## Running experiments

For running jobs on ADA, we recommend using copies the submission scripts provided in this folder.

**NOTE: Scripts will not run properly if done whilst the conda environment is active.**

### Running `tsml-eval` CPU experiments

For CPU experiments start with one of the following scripts:

>classification_experiments.sh

>regression_experiments.sh

>clustering_experiments.sh

You may need to use `dos2unix` to convert the line endings to unix format.

The default queue for CPU jobs is _compute-64-512_, but you may want to swap to _compute-24-128_ or _compute-24-96_
if they have more resources available.

Do not run threaded code on the cluster without reserving whole nodes, as there is nothing to stop the job from using
the CPU resources allocated to others. The default python file in the scripts attempts to avoid threading as much as possible. You should ensure processes are not intentionally using multiple threads if you change it.

Requesting memory for a job will allocate it all on the jobs assigned node. New jobs will not be submitted to a node if the total allocated memory exceeds the amount available for the node. As such, requesting too much memory can block new jobs from using the node. This is ok if the memory is actually being used, but large amounts of memory should not be requested unless you know it will be required for the jobs you are submitting. ADA is a shared resource, and instantly requesting hundreds of GB will hurt the overall efficiency of the cluster.

### Running `tsml-eval` GPU experiments

For GPU experiments use one of the following scripts:

>gpu_classification_experiments.sh

>gpu_regression_experiments.sh

>gpu_clustering_experiments.sh

It is recommended you use different environments for CPU and GPU jobs.

The default queue for GPU jobs is _gpu-rtx_.

If you will be running a lot of jobs, it may be worth booking out the reserved gpu qos (_gpu-rtx-reserved_).

Note that if you get the message

"sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid qos specification"

it means you are not set up to use the gpu. Please email hpc.admin@uea.ac.uk to get permission.

## Monitoring jobs on ADA

check queues

>lshosts

list processes for user (mind that the quotes may not be the correct ones)

>squeue -u USERNAME --format="%12i %15P %20j %10u %10t %10M %10D %20R" -r

__Tip__: to simplify and just use 'queue' in the terminal to run the above command, add this to the .bashrc file located in your home:

>alias queue='squeue -u USERNAME --format="%12i %15P %20j %10u %10t %10M %10D %20R" -r'

GPU queue

>squeue -p gpu-rtx6000-2

To kill all user jobs

>scancel -u USERNAME

To delete all jobs on a queue it’s:

>scancel -p QUEUE

To delete one job it’s:

>scancel 11133013_1
