    "# tsml-eval Results Format\n",
    "\n",
    "`tsml-eval` experiment functions will output a .csv result file in the `tsml` format. This file can contain infromation about the experiment such as the predictions made by the algorithm and the time taken to run the experiment. These result files can be used in the evaluation module to compare the performance of different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the result files have some common characteristics, each learning task has its own unique format. This notebook will outline the standard parts of the result files, them go over the individual format of each learning task.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "All experiments files will follow the same general format:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Line 1 contains information about the experiment being run; the items are the same for all results files:\n",
    "    * `dataset` - the name of the dataset used in the experiment.\n",
    "    * `algorithm` - the name of the algorithm used in the experiment.\n",
    "    * `split` - the split of the dataset used in the experiment (i.e. train or test).\n",
    "    * `resample id` - the dataset resample id or random seed used in the experiment.\n",
    "    * `time unit` - the time unit used to measure the experiment (i.e. milliseconds or nanoseconds).\n",
    "    * `description` - a description of the experiment, this is optional and can contain commas.\n",
    "* Line 2 contains parameter information from the estimator used in the experiment. This is specific to the estimator used and is generally free form, containing both input parameters and relevant information from fit if required. This line can contain any number of commas.   \n",
    "* Line 3 contains results from the experiment. This is specific to the learning task and will be covered in the following sections, but will contain the following as the first 5 items:\n",
    "    * `performance` - a commonly used performance metric for the task (i.e. accuracy or MSE).\n",
    "    * `fit time` - the time taken to fit the model.\n",
    "    * `predict time` - the time taken to make predictions for all cases in the file.\n",
    "    * `benchmark time` - the time taken to run a simple function (i.e. sorting _n_ arrays), used as a hardware benchmark.\n",
    "    * `memory usage` - the memory usage of fit, in `tsml-eval` experiments this is the max memory usage recorded during the fit process.\n",
    "* Remaining lines record the results for each case. There should be as many lines as there are cases in the dataset, the ordering for each case should match that of the dataset used. The format of these lines is again specific to the learning task and will be covered in the following sections. The lines will follow a similar format to the following, however, with some tasks not recording probabilities:\n",
    "    * `target` - the target variable for the case.\n",
    "    * `prediction` - the estimator prediction for the case.\n",
    "    * `probabilities` - the estimator probabilities for the case, this is available for all tasks. Preceded by an extra comma.\n",
    "    * `prediction time` - the time to make the prediction. Optional and preceded by an extra comma.\n",
    "    * `description` - additional details for the case. Optional and preceded by an extra comma but requires prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some results can hold default/missing values such as -1 if they are not recorded. This is sometimes the case for metrics such as memory usage and benchmark time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we provide an example of generating a classification results file."
