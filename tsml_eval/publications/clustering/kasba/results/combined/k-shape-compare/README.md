# K-Shape Compare
The results in this section are used for Section 5.4 of the paper. Each clusterer
is setup with the experiment setup outlined in [1]. We set each clusterer to use a
maximum of 100 iterations. For k-Shape and k-AVG we use random initialisation. For
KASBA we use the elastic kmeans++. We run the experiment 10 times and average the
results. Each experiment uses a different random seed (0, 1, ..., 9).
